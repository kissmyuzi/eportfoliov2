<p><strong>““““</strong></p>

<p><strong>This is our world now… the world of the electron and the switch, the beauty of the baud. […]</strong>
<strong>Yes, I am a criminal. My crime is that of curiosity. My crime is that of judging people by what they say and think, not what they look like. […]</strong>
<strong>I am a hacker, and this is my manifesto.</strong></p>

<p><strong>””””</strong></p>

<p>First published on January 8, 1986, the Hacker Manifesto was considered the ethical foundation for decades of hacker culture. 33 years later, where hacking is now exposed in detail to the whole world, such values still hold true at BSides Canberra 2019, the largest computer security conference in Australia.</p>

<p>My name is Andy, and I am a current committee member of UTS Cyber Security Society (CSEC), I’m a 2nd year Software Engineering student that loves to tinker and figuring out how things work. For the purpose of this article, I hope to share the experience of the trip through the perspective of a student.</p>

<p>The journey began on Thursday 14th of March with the Cyber bus, courtesy of UNSW’s Security Society (SecSoc) a mix of students from UNSW, UTS, MacU, and USYD were invited onboard. The conference itself was held in the National Convention Centre, located in the heart of Canberra’s Central Business District.</p>

<p>17 talks, 3 competitions and 7 workshops in the span of 48 hours, the organisers this year really outdid themselves in diversifying the events. This year being my first BSides conference, I was pleasantly surprised at the balance of lectures and hands-on activities available.
My two favourite talks from the event were:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>What’s in a Jailbreak? Hacking the iPhone: 2014 -&gt; 2019</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Presented by Mark Dowd (@mdowd), the talk delved into the underlying hardware and software security solutions by Apple for flagship product: iPhone. I was blown away by the creativity of both the attacker and Apple in the “jailbreak” arms race.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Sample 78: Deconstruction of A Linux Adversarial Toolkit</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Presented by Christian Giuffre (@int3rrupt), it was a treat to observe a “Frankenstein” style reconstruction of a real-world Linux implant toolkit. This digital walking tour of malware analysis proved to be a dime and was one of the most engaging talk of Day 2.</p>

<p>^Locksport Village: Lockpick tables are available for visitors to practice on locks of varying difficulty and participate in the lockpicking Competition.</p>

<p><img src="../../img/challenge site.jpg" alt="competition" /></p>

<p>^ Competition site: CTF “The Fall of Cybeartron”, ACSC IR challenge and Pwn 2 drone. The competitions were held at roughly the same time.  </p>

<p>Feedback from my fellow students:</p>

<p>“BSides Canberra 2019 served to be one of the most productive and interactive experiences of my academic/learning life. The multitude of presentations accommodated a huge variety of security concepts and at varying levels of complexity – allowing for someone inexperienced such as myself to gain much knowledge. The CTF event, while beyond my capabilities, introduced me to the thrill of dissecting and tinkering with complex problems, encouraging lifelong lessons such as the importance of critical thinking. Above all else, BSides introduced me to one of the closest-knit sectors of the computing industry, paving the way for career opportunities and lifelong friendships.”
– Ben Collins (Third year Student)</p>

<p>“Being a first year student, I’d be lying if i said I wasn’t anxious about attending BSides. Going to the largest security conference in Australia and having little hacking knowledge, I thought the experience would be too overwhelming, but to my surprise it was far from that. As I didn’t have much background in hacking and security I did occasionally struggle to grasp the content of some of the more technical seminars, but just being around this welcoming environment and community was valuable in itself. I was encouraged to enquire and ask questions about anything I was confused about, and after the 2 day conference I had learnt much more than I anticipated. I came back home with a wealth of knowledge, but more importantly a newfound hunger for cyber security and to me, that was invaluable.”
-Karim Yahia (first year student)</p>

<p>Overall, BSides Canberra 2019 was a welcoming conference for both veterans and those who are taking their first step into the industry. I would like to thank Silvio and Kylie for organising this amazing conference and borrowing their words:
“We hack without skin colour, nationality, religious bias, or gender.
For we are the hackers of BSides Canberra, and this conference is our manifesto.”</p>
