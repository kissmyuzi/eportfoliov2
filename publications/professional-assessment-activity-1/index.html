<h3 id="peer-review">Peer Review</h3>

<p>Times are changing and with more and more online applications, an E-portfolio is a great alternative from a traditional CV as it gives the recruiter a more polished overview upon the individual’s skill and experience. During the second week we were tasked to have 3 journals ready for peer review on our E-portfolio. We were tasked to comment on our peer’s E-portfolio with our personal set of criteria, mine is as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Home page</strong>: Include an executive summary of the student, such as the name, major, university, contact info and any relevant academic achievements.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>About:</strong> A personal bio on student and should include a picture of the student.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Resume:</strong>  Easy to find, access and download.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Academic Experience and Projects:</strong> Provide evidence such as diagrams, charts and images to display the student’s work.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Professional Experience:</strong> Provide evidence such as images for the student’s past work or internship experience.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Research:</strong> Depending on the student, this section should include a description of research supported by artefacts such as images, diagrams, presentations and charts.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>This exercise proved to be very effective as the portfolios were viewed by different perspectives. The feedbacks I received from my peer group was to implement a better navigation system for journal viewing and I have personally decided to change the dark aesthetics to a much brighter one to reflect the professionalism of an engineer. However, given that both of my subjects that I’m taking requires a e-portfolio, I have decided to implement them both as one. I will first begin to copy all the journals from my old Blogspot site to the one I have built using Hugo. Another benefit of transferring across my EPP1 journals to the new site would be the better navigation system, with the tabs on the left being the main controller. The name of the site is “Resume”, which aims to simplify the content for the reader and to have a fast overview of my current status.</p>

<p>Members in my group are Bilal, Nathan, Christina and Ekam, below is the filled-out feedback I gave to my peers.</p>
