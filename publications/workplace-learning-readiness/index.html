<h3 id="what-i-aim-to-learn-from-the-internship">What I aim to learn from the internship</h3>

<p>As a current second year student studying engineering, I intend to acquire valuable industry insights from professional engineering teams. I am also looking forward to getting hands-on experience in detection, mitigate and secure infrastructure.</p>

<p>Another area of focus would be communication, which entails the ability to communicate information correctly, succinctly and without obstruction. The emerging international landscape means a diverse workforce from a multitude of background. Gender, Religion and language are all barriers that must be broken for the success of engineering projects. &ldquo;Groups are particularly good at combining talents and providing innovative solutions to possibly unfamiliar problems;&rdquo; (Blair, G.1991, p. 219)</p>

<p>As a student majoring in software Engineering but has a strong interest in Cyber security, I aim to work in a role related to either my major or Cyber Security.</p>

<p><img src="../../img/Learning prep table.JPG" alt="Learning Prep" /></p>

<p>^ A work plan I created for my first internship during the EPP1 (Engineering Practice Preparation) tutorial sessions.</p>

<h3 id="my-preparation-for-workplace-learning">My preparation for workplace learning</h3>

<p>Throughout the summer semester I took two subjects: Engineering Practice Preparation 1 (EPP1) and Cyber Security(An Offensive Mindset). EPP1 was an interesting subject that focused on maximising our potential during the internship process, while “Cyber Security: An Offensive Mindset” polished my technical and industry knowledge. Since I have written about “An Offensive Mindset” quite extensively in my journals, I will dedicate this topic to EPP1.</p>

<h4 id="epp1-subject-description">EPP1 Subject Description</h4>

<p>This subject provides students with the opportunities to collaborate with their peers and the subject&rsquo;s teaching staff, to explore the social practices involved in seeking, obtaining, contributing to and learning from an engineering job or internship. Students are guided in the curation of an e-portfolio that documents their growing understanding of the practices necessary for seeking and obtaining a professional engineering experience. The e-portfolios also document the student&rsquo;s growing capabilities to contribute to a workplace, and to engage in workplace learning focusing particularly on the interpersonal and communication capabilities that may be required in engineering workplaces.</p>

<p><strong>EPP1 Subject Learning Outcomes (SLOs)</strong></p>

<p>Upon successful completion of this subject students should be able to:</p>

<ol>
<li>Articulate preparedness for participating in an engineering workplace</li>
<li>Document and communicate their capabilities to contribute to a workplace and engage in workplace learning</li>
</ol>

<p>Personally, EPP1 has been a continuous path of self- evaluation and provided valuable feedback towards our e-portfolios. EPP1 first made me realise the importance of social networks in the modern industry, so utilising lecture notes I began refining my LinkedIn profile. Profile photo? Check. Outline? Check. Next, I focused on industry events in which I pushed myself to get as many connections as I can. I started to post about my experience at the industry events, which led to 1000+ views and a sharp increase of profile views by industry professionals.</p>

<p>Another area that I discovered from EPP1 was added advantage of having an E-portfolio. Times are changing and with more and more online applications, an E-portfolio is a great alternative from a traditional CV as it gives the recruiter a more polished overview upon the individual’s skill and experience. During the second week we were tasked to have 3 journals ready for peer review on our E-portfolio. The feedback I received from my peer group was to implement a better navigation system for journal viewing, so I completely recreated my site using Hugo for better aesthetic and  navigation system.</p>

<p>Overall, the sessions I have developed myself towards becoming a better employee. I strongly believe that the soft skills and career insights that EPP1 has taught me will aid me in my future workplace.</p>
