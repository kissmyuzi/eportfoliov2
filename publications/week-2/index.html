<h3 id="problem-statement-slo-1">PROBLEM STATEMENT (SLO 1)</h3>

<p>In the midst of modern Cyber arms-race, human error still remains as the number one cause of data breaches. Human error accounts for more than half of all successful Cyber Security breaches, with social engineering being the forefront attack vector still relevant today. I have decided to incorporate this problem into the Web Application testing which we are currently undertaking this week.</p>

<h3 id="ethincal-hacking-and-bug-bounties-slo-2">ETHINCAL HACKING AND BUG BOUNTIES (SLO 2)</h3>

<p>Ethical hacking is a controlled method to find out the weaknesses and vulnerabilities existing in a system or network. In the current technology- centric society, no business is without the use of IT, but such dependency comes at a cost without proper security countermeasures. Mr. Agarwal from TechnoSip Inc summed it up quite well, “Essentially, they&rsquo;re the gatekeepers for the organization, in order to prevent an unethical hacker from inflicting any damage.” (Forbes.com, 2019) Current trends of rewarding bug bounties and hiring penetration testing services allows a company to receive vital feedback on its defensive capabilities.</p>

<p>A responsible disclosure policy is the first step a company can take to protect itself from a premature vulnerability release to the public. The responsible disclosure is different from a full disclosure model as there is a time frame for the issue to be patched before it is disclosed to the public. The following is an example:</p>

<p><img src="https://kissmyuzi.github.io/ePortfolio/img/disclosure%20artifact.JPG" alt="disclosure image" /></p>

<p>^SLO 2 Artefact 1: An example of responsible disclosure policy for the ficticious company ACME corporation.</p>

<p>During sprint 1, our group completed our presentation on bug bounty programs, with bug crowd being the main site of research. This week I aim to test web applications under a responsible disclosure from Bug Crowd using the techniques I gained from participating in Pentesterlabs. The target scope with additional details is provided after a program is selected, program such as Netflix and Stan both possess relevant responsible disclosure policy tagged in their web application programs.</p>

<p><img src="https://kissmyuzi.github.io/ePortfolio/img/Netflix%20artifact.JPG" alt="netflix program image" /></p>

<p>^SLO 2 Artefact 2: Bug Bounty program by Netflix on Bugcrowd.</p>

<p>SLO 2 is reached as the newly identified problem, web application security can be mitigated through bug bounty program hosted by organisations such Bugcrowd and HackerOne.</p>

<h3 id="focus-area-clickjacking-slo-3-4">FOCUS AREA: CLICKJACKING (SLO 3 + 4)</h3>

<p>Click-Jacking otherwise known as &lsquo;UI redress attack&rsquo; combines both elements of social engineering and Web application to &ldquo;hijack&rdquo; clicks and routing them to dangerous domains or applications. The technique is quite simple, the attacker will first need to create a combination of sylesheets, iframes and text boxes to bait the user into believing that they are typing their passwords to a legit site.</p>

<p>OWASP.org presented an excellent example:</p>

<p><em>For example, imagine an attacker who builds a web site that has a button on it that says &ldquo;click here for a free iPod&rdquo;. However, on top of that web page, the attacker has loaded an iframe with your mail account, and lined up exactly the &ldquo;delete all messages&rdquo; button directly on top of the &ldquo;free iPod&rdquo; button. The victim tries to click on the &ldquo;free iPod&rdquo; button but instead actually clicked on the invisible &ldquo;delete all messages&rdquo; button. In essence, the attacker has &ldquo;hijacked&rdquo; the user&rsquo;s click, hence the name &ldquo;Clickjacking&rdquo;.</em> - www.owasp.org/index.php/Clickjacking</p>

<p>*<strong>note: Due to the disclosure nature of this program, I have censored all information regarding the program website.</strong></p>

<p>So starting off, I began testing the website with OWASP Zed Attack Proxy(ZAP), a tool to automatically scan security vulnerabilities in a web application. which yielded one medium level bug as shown below.</p>

<p><img src="https://kissmyuzi.github.io/ePortfolio/img/clickjacking%20evidence_LI.jpg" alt="scan result image" /></p>

<p>^SLO 3 Artefact 1: Flags found in the target site by OWASP ZAP.</p>

<p>The next step was to analyse the report, which showed that alert level, description and solution to the vulnerability.</p>

<p><img src="https://kissmyuzi.github.io/ePortfolio/img/report%20evidence_LI.jpg" alt="report image" /></p>

<p>^SLO 3 Artefact 2: HTML report generated by OWASP ZAP.</p>

<p>Finally I conducted my research from numerous sources such as <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Clickjacking">OWASP Click-Jacking</a> to learn about this technique and its implications upon the users and completed a final check on the target website to confirm the vulnerability.</p>

<p><img src="https://kissmyuzi.github.io/ePortfolio/img/iframe%20evidence_LI.jpg" alt="final check image" /></p>

<p>^SLO 3 Artefact 3: Use inspect and search &lsquo;iframe&rsquo; to locate it.</p>

<p>Overall, this vulnerability classifies in the medium catagory as it preys on human error, and can be remediated in two main ways according to OWASP:</p>

<ol>
<li>Sending the proper Content Security Policy (CSP) frame-ancestors directive response headers that instruct the browser to not allow framing from other domains. (This replaces the older X-Frame-Options HTTP headers.)</li>
<li>Employing defensive code in the UI to ensure that the current frame is the most top level window.</li>
</ol>

<p>Many sites were hacked this way, including Twitter, Facebook, Paypal and other sites. They are all fixed, of course but this problem is still relevant today as it is classified as a medium/low level vulnerability.</p>

<p>SLO 3 is achieved through my discovery of the ClickJacking vulnerability, while SLO 4 is undertaken as we were give 3 minutes to present our findings to our &lsquo;corporate stakeholders&rsquo;. I successfully conveyed my research and received great feedback from Larry, our head educator.</p>

<p>SLO 4 Artefact 1: My Presentation Slides- <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1XZjcM4suiJlE30CWtgJmtnlWvVX1vl2MlYBYzlMO8jU/edit?usp=sharing">https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1XZjcM4suiJlE30CWtgJmtnlWvVX1vl2MlYBYzlMO8jU/edit?usp=sharing</a></p>

<h3 id="personal-reflection-slo-5">PERSONAL REFLECTION (SLO 5)</h3>

<p>Previously in the about me section, my personal goals included:</p>

<ol>
<li>Understand tools and techniques from OWASP top 10 to relate to vulnerable web applications.</li>
<li>Gain a better understanding of the Cyber Security Sector in general.</li>
</ol>

<p>However, after the sprint 1, I have began developing a strong interest in bug bounty programs. Thus, the ultimate goal i have set for myself is to achieve a successful medium or high level bug report for a web- application based program on BugCrowd. Realistically, my current mindset still lacks the technical capabilities to visually identify anomalies in the web applications.</p>

<p>To achieve the level of competency to satisfy my goal, I will first develop the basic mindset of error testing through practice. I was recommended the course: <a href="https://www.pentesterlab.com/exercises/web_for_pentester/">Web for Pentester</a> So for now my current milestone/plan is:</p>

<ol>
<li>Finish Web for Pentester by the end of the sprint 2.</li>
<li>Research disclosed bug bounty reports.</li>
<li>Practice hackthebox challenges.</li>
</ol>
