<h3 id="slo-1-slo-4-group-reflection">SLO 1, SLO 4 + GROUP REFLECTION</h3>

<p>A summer studio takes place approximately a month before the usual Autumn university session, utilizing a condensed teaching format of 4 weeks instead of a usual university semester. Out of the many choices to select from, I chose Cybersecurity: An Offensive Mindset as my 6-credit summer course as my personal aim was to find an internship immediately after the holidays.</p>

<p>On the first day (4/02/2019) we were assigned to present upon a Cybersecurity topic of our own choice in groups of 4 to 5. The task was due on Wednesday (in two days), so I got to work immediately with picking out a group. The team I decided to join was composed of a mixed skillset, with the veterans being Jason, Andre and I as we were involved in the UTS Cybersec society beforehand. However, the new members: Frank and Vishal were both hard working software engineering students in their final year. The group selection gave us a perfect opportunity to practice our interpersonal, leadership and communication skills.</p>

<p><img src="https://kissmyuzi.github.io/ePortfolio/img/Teams%20artifact.JPG" alt="SLO1 image" /></p>

<p>^ SLO 1 Artefact 1: We decided to use Microsoft Teams as a form of communication.</p>

<p>I strongly believe in the importance of team communication, so we used one of my preferred tools, Microsoft Teams to act as our project planner. After we dissected the project into 4 steps, we used google slides to complete our presentation slides. Of course, there was initial friction within the team when we were trying to decide upon the topic, but after a couple of rounds of voting we decided to research bug bounty and isolated steam as our technical case study.</p>

<p><img src="https://kissmyuzi.github.io/ePortfolio/img/Presentation%20artifact.png" alt="SLO1 image" /></p>

<p>^ SLO 4 Artefact 1: Our team presenting at the front.</p>

<p>So, what have we achieved?</p>

<p>The topic we chose to present is the bug bounty program, where you “get paid to hack things”. A bug bounty is a program which crowdsources bug hunting for target software products and services which rewards hackers reporting these bugs with money and recognition.</p>

<p>We then delved into a case where valve pays 15000 pounds to a hacker who found a steam bug that generates free games. Artem, who was the hacker, passed in specific URL parameters that gave him access to API endpoint calls to get multiple game Product keys.</p>

<p>Overall the presentation went extremely smoothly and gave us an important insight of teamwork, and provided the students with a fresh way to learn from each other. Thus SLO 1 was fulfilled as a group when we where trying to identify a Cyber Security problem, while SLO 4 was explored during our presentation and its completion process.</p>

<p>Here is our presentation slides: <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1e3WunCcSdGv09VA77-9W8lBUlbU3uerzyue-1ow_glc/edit?usp=sharing">https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1e3WunCcSdGv09VA77-9W8lBUlbU3uerzyue-1ow_glc/edit?usp=sharing</a></p>

<h3 id="slo-2-slo-3">SLO 2, SLO 3</h3>

<p>The most difficult task given to us in week 1 was to create our own Static website to host weekly reflections, submissions and ultimately post our portfolio which is due in week 4.</p>

<p>We were given the following intro:</p>

<p>• Dynamic sites require the use of server-side scripting that increases the possibilities of vulnerabilities and attacks. Whilst dynamic sites are required for many web applications, static sites are gaining popularity for their simplicity and for their increased security</p>

<p>• Static sites are presented using plain HTML with no server-side scripting required. This usually requires the use of a static site generator that is able to take input files written in mark-up (e.g. Markdown)</p>

<p>In all honesty, other than a blog which I created using Blogger, I had no experience in creating a static website. Thus, after conducting my personal research, I first started with Jekyll to generate a site using an existing theme. However, I ran into many troubles with server hosting, so I decided to skip the static generation component and started with a template found on startBootstrap.com. After consulting with a senior software student(Vishal) who was familiar with front-end development, I was taught the Git process on the Friday afternoon.</p>

<p><img src="https://kissmyuzi.github.io/ePortfolio/img/github%20artifact.JPG" alt="SLO1 image" /></p>

<p>^ SLO 3 Artefact 1: The succeeded Git push onto my master branch.</p>

<p>I started off learning the utilisation of GitHub-Pages, and through trial and error, I linked GitHub with GitKraken, a Git Client widely used in the development industry. Saturday was dedicated to the addition of all the content on this website and learning HTML on the go. It was quite the challenge as the only language I learnt during my first year was Java, but I viewed this as an opportunity to learn a new skill and further advance myself outside of my comfort zone.</p>

<p><img src="https://kissmyuzi.github.io/ePortfolio/img/github%20artifact.JPG" alt="SLO1 image" /></p>

<p>^ SLO 2 Artefact 1: The HTML code I used in this website.</p>

<p>The creation of the static website further reinforced the notion of combining technical skills outlined in SLO 3 with the creative adaption outlined in SLO 2 to overcome obstacles such as the problematic server.</p>

<h3 id="slo-5-subject-reflection">SLO 5 + SUBJECT REFLECTION</h3>

<p>The teaching staff was extremely supportive as they conducted their teaching. Larry was very direct and concise when disclosing information, while the Microsoft Team class group was also a great addition to aid our communication when we wanted to voice our questions. Darsh is very supportive in the communication side as he answered all my questions about the presentation task and gave our ideas great feedback.</p>

<p><img src="https://kissmyuzi.github.io/ePortfolio/img/darsh%20artefact.JPG" alt="SLO1 image" /></p>

<p>^ SLO 5 Artifact 1: Darsh responding to my question on Teams.</p>

<p>Another feedback session was held between Larry and each student after the presentation, which encompassed our personal progress in the subject. Thus, from undertaking the first week of this subject I am already optimistic that this subject will cover all my expectations and aims outlined at the start.</p>

<h3 id="subject-learning-outcomes-slos">SUBJECT LEARNING OUTCOMES(SLOs)</h3>

<p>There are 5 major subject learning outcomes with this course and the achievement of these outcomes will be outlined by this portfolio. The SLO’s are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Engage with Stakeholders to identify a problem (empathizing/ defining the problem)</li>
<li>Apply Design Thinking to respond to a defined or newly identified problem</li>
<li>Apply Technical skills to develop, model and/or evaluate design (refining/ test a prototype)</li>
<li>Demonstrate effective collaboration and communication</li>
<li>Conduct critical self and peer review and performance evaluation (both as an individual and a team)</li>
</ol>
