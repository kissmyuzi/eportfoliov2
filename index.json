I am also looking forward to getting hands-on experience in detection, mitigate and secure infrastructure.\nAnother area of focus would be communication, which entails the ability to communicate information correctly, succinctly and without obstruction. The emerging international landscape means a diverse workforce from a multitude of background. Gender, Religion and language are all barriers that must be broken for the success of engineering projects. \u0026ldquo;Groups are particularly good at combining talents and providing innovative solutions to possibly unfamiliar problems;\u0026rdquo; (Blair, G.1991, p. 219)\nAs a student majoring in software Engineering but has a strong interest in Cyber security, I aim to work in a role related to either my major or Cyber Security.\n^ A work plan I created for my first internship during the EPP1 (Engineering Practice Preparation) tutorial sessions.\nMy preparation for workplace learning Throughout the summer semester I took two subjects: Engineering Practice Preparation 1 (EPP1) and Cyber Security(An Offensive Mindset). EPP1 was an interesting subject that focused on maximising our potential during the internship process, while “Cyber Security: An Offensive Mindset” polished my technical and industry knowledge. Since I have written about “An Offensive Mindset” quite extensively in my journals, I will dedicate this topic to EPP1.\nEPP1 Subject Description This subject provides students with the opportunities to collaborate with their peers and the subject\u0026rsquo;s teaching staff, to explore the social practices involved in seeking, obtaining, contributing to and learning from an engineering job or internship. Students are guided in the curation of an e-portfolio that documents their growing understanding of the practices necessary for seeking and obtaining a professional engineering experience. The e-portfolios also document the student\u0026rsquo;s growing capabilities to contribute to a workplace, and to engage in workplace learning focusing particularly on the interpersonal and communication capabilities that may be required in engineering workplaces.\nEPP1 Subject Learning Outcomes (SLOs)\nUpon successful completion of this subject students should be able to:\n Articulate preparedness for participating in an engineering workplace Document and communicate their capabilities to contribute to a workplace and engage in workplace learning  Personally, EPP1 has been a continuous path of self- evaluation and provided valuable feedback towards our e-portfolios. EPP1 first made me realise the importance of social networks in the modern industry, so utilising lecture notes I began refining my LinkedIn profile. Profile photo? Check. Outline? Check. Next, I focused on industry events in which I pushed myself to get as many connections as I can. I started to post about my experience at the industry events, which led to 1000+ views and a sharp increase of profile views by industry professionals.\nAnother area that I discovered from EPP1 was added advantage of having an E-portfolio. Times are changing and with more and more online applications, an E-portfolio is a great alternative from a traditional CV as it gives the recruiter a more polished overview upon the individual’s skill and experience. During the second week we were tasked to have 3 journals ready for peer review on our E-portfolio. The feedback I received from my peer group was to implement a better navigation system for journal viewing, so I completely recreated my site using Hugo for better aesthetic and navigation system.\nOverall, the sessions I have developed myself towards becoming a better employee. I strongly believe that the soft skills and career insights that EPP1 has taught me will aid me in my future workplace.\n","permalink":"/publications/workplace-learning-readiness/","tags":null,"title":"Workplace Learning Readiness"},{"categories":null,"contents":" SCRUM REFLECTION (SLO 5) Scrum, a well known method to addess complex adaptive problems was introduced to us from week 1. The execution was simple, the entire class was tasked to stand and report our current progress/difficulties to people we are unfamiliar to. After 6-7 minutes, Larry would choose a random person from each group to present their scrum notes to the class.\n^Scrum Notes: Notes on my peer\u0026rsquo;s progress and challenges.\nThe rundown for this week\u0026rsquo;s scrum:\nIan:\n Participated in testing of real world applications(Bounty Programs).\n Completed \u0026ldquo;Curling\u0026rdquo; from Hack The Box(HTB) and found that the part towards the end to be challenging.\n  Rowan:\n Completing \u0026ldquo;Mr. Robot\u0026rdquo; HTB and found the privilege escalation component quite challenging.\n Having trouble with the WPScan query.\n  Oliver:\n Completed \u0026ldquo;Fristi- Leaks\u0026rdquo; which was quite simple at first but was difficult for privilege escalation.  Andy:\n Completed testing of real world applications(Bounty Programs).\n Undertaking \u0026ldquo;Mr. Robot\u0026rdquo; from TryHackMe.\n Found the WPScan to be ineffective for the site but used alternate method to enumerate user.\n  Throughout the past weeks Scrum has been a great addition to the course as it not only provided a chance to practice public speaking, but provided confidence to those who are isolated and stuck. Scrum breaks down the imaginary barriers we each built to isolate ourselves to the problems, and alters it into a collaboration effort. I am truly thankful to the educators of this course: Larry, Darsh, Jai and Luke for drilling this concept into us, as it will be the foundation of problem solving at professional work environments.\nDELOITTE PRESENTATION (SLO 3) Wednesday started off with a memorable presentation regarding Red Team operations and pentesting in general. The three presenters initally presented on the wide scope of Red Team Operations compared to the topic of penetration testing. The latter part of the presentation was hands-on, the aim was to gain root on a vulnerable virtual machine called \u0026ldquo;Piper\u0026rdquo;.\n^Overview of Red Team Operations by Deloitte.\nWe then had a \u0026ldquo;Piper\u0026rdquo; walkthrough presented on Friday by Jai and Jason, providing great insight to the mindset when actually tackling such challenges. The walkthrough helped me significantly with my own attempt at \u0026ldquo;Mr. Robot\u0026rdquo; due to the similar method of privilege escalation.\nGROUP PRESENTATION: AIRCRACK-NG (SLO 4)  Present a case study on one or more tool(s), and how these tool(s) can be used to break into complex and vulnerable systems. Make sure to include examples. Keep it high-level. Presentations are to be 6 to 7 minutes. No less, no more. Presentations will be conducted in groups. Presentations will be held between 1PM and 2PM.  Similar to the first week presentation, I created a new team(Vishal, Ian, Frank and I) in Microsoft Teams as a planner for the presentation. Our topic was Aircrack-ng, a suite of tools for WiFi network security, and split the research into one major tool per person while Ian conducted the Intro and conclusion.\n^Planner we used on Microsoft Teams.\nMy research: Aireplay\nUsage:\naireplay-ng \u0026lt;options\u0026gt; \u0026lt;replay interface\u0026gt;  Included in the Aircrack-ng package, Aireplay is used to inject wireless frames. Its main purpose is to generate traffic to be used in-conjunction with Aircrack for cracking WEP and WPA Pre-Shared keys.\nDifferent attack modes are chosen with their designated numbers:\n0. Deauthenticate 1 or all stations.\n1. Fake authentication with access point.\n2. Interactive packet replay or injection.\n3. Standard Address Resolution Protocol- request replay\n4. Decrypt WEP packets without needing the key..\n5. Generate valid keystream\nFor example, using Aireplay an attacker can deauthenticate 1 or all wireless clients connected to a particular access point, and then plant a cloned fake access point to easily sniff out all the incoming and outgoing connections.\nPresentation Slides\nFurther Reading:\nFOCUS OPTION 1: OWN A VULNERABLE MACHINE OF YOUR CHOICE (SLO 1 + 2 + 3) We were given the objective of owning a vulnerable machine from the following list:\n VulnHub (see resources below) HTB - Retired Cyber Security Challenge Australia - in-a-box TryHackMe (one of the boxes) Any other boot 2 root images you find (please reach out if you are unsure)  I proceeded to undertake an intermediate challenge: \u0026ldquo;Mr. Robot\u0026rdquo; from TryHackMe.com using Kali Linux 64 bit running on my VM workstation. Acccording to the guidelines, there are a total of 3 flags that I have to obtain, with each having a clue and flag submission box.\n^ Option 1 Artefact 0: Overview of the virtual machine.\nBelow is my attempt at gaining Root privilege:\n1. First of all, setup the Mr. Robot virtual machine by connecting through the TryHackMe network using openVPN and click on the \u0026ldquo;Deploy\u0026rdquo; button to receive the machine\u0026rsquo;s IP Address.\n^Option 1 Artefact 1: Network config. instructions.\n2. Using the given IP address(10.0.0.73), I ran a nmap scan:\nnmap -sSV -n -T4 -p1-5000 10.0.0.73\n^Option 1 Artefact 2: Initial nmap scan.\n3. I then applied the formatted address into the FireFox browser:\nhttps://10.0.0.73:443\n^Option 1 Artefact 3: Successful connection with the web page.\n4. From the first hint, \u0026ldquo;Robots\u0026rdquo; I figured that the correct direction was to request the Robot.txt file. By the input of:\nhttps://10.0.0.73/robots.txt in the browser.\n^Option 1 Artefact 4: A dictionary file and the first flag was found!\nAfter inputting the respective requests in the browser, https://10.0.0.73/fsocity https://10.0.0.73/key-1-of-3.txt\nI received the a download option for a word list and the first flag.\n5. Out of curiosity, I tried to input: https://10.0.0.73/help which resulted in an \u0026ldquo;error page not found\u0026rdquo; from Wordpress. Thus, I experimented by trying out https://10.0.0.73/login, which results in the wordpress login page.\n^Option 1 Artefact 5: Exposure of wordpress login page.\n6. An interesting feature on WordPress is the invalid username notification, which could be exploited to enumerate the users of the site.\n^Option 1 Artefact 6.1: Invalid username notification triggered regardless of the password.\nThus after researching the context of the challenge, I compiled a list of characters in the film to try out in the username field. After around 10 minutes, I found the username: \u0026lsquo;Elliot\u0026rsquo; registered on the site.\n^Option 1 Artefact 6.2: Valid username notification.\n7. The next step was to find the password tied to the \u0026lsquo;Elliot\u0026rsquo; user, one of the option was to use the WPScan but a much more simple approach was to remove all duplicates from the dictionary file \u0026lsquo;fsocity.dic\u0026rsquo;.\nUsing the following command:\nsort fsocity.dic | uniq -u \u0026gt; newfsocity.dic\nI then found the valid password through manual input into the password field.\n^Option 1 Artefact 7: Admin wordpress dashboard.\n8. Next, after researching online, I came to the conclusion of editing the PHP file of the 404 page to achieve reverse shell. Elliot\u0026rsquo;s admin account proved to be very useful to perform this exploit, while a quick google search of \u0026ldquo;php reverse shell\u0026rdquo; yield many great scripts to choose from. I chose \u0026ldquo;php-reverse-shell\u0026rdquo; from Pentestmonkey as it was the first result.\n^Option 1 Artefact 8: \u0026ldquo;php-reverse-shell\u0026rdquo; download page.\n9. Now for the fun part, login to Elliot\u0026rsquo;s account and and head to Editor in the \u0026ldquo;Appearance tab\u0026rdquo; and replace the \u0026ldquo;404 Template\u0026rdquo; content with the \u0026ldquo;php- reverse-shell\u0026rdquo;. However, before updating the file you need to change the throwback IP to your own and add a random port.\n^Option 1 Artefact 9.1: \u0026ldquo;php-reverse-shell\u0026rdquo; in the 404 template page.\nBefore running the updated 404 page, I ran a listener through Netcat with the same port I specified in the \u0026ldquo;php-reverse-shell\u0026rdquo; script.\n^Option 1 Artefact 9.2: Successful reverse shell using Netcat. *Warning: The following pics containing Mr. Robot machine\u0026rsquo;s IP address may be different from previous pics due to machine timeout, but will possess similar layout: 10.0.0.XXX 10. With the only hints left being \u0026ldquo;White coloured font\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;nmap\u0026rdquo;, I proceeded to research privilege escalation methods involving fonts and nmap. Luckily I came across Penetration Testing Lab\u0026rsquo;s article on SUID Executables, which detailed the use of existing binaries and utilities to escalate privliges to root if they have SUID permission. Nmap, Vim, find and Bash are some of teh tools that could be exploited, but I believe the correct lies in nmap.\n^Option 1 Artefact 10.1: privilege Escalation instructions from Pentestlab.blog.\nAfter running the above commands, it would be clear as to which executable to exploit. Similar to the hint \u0026ldquo;nmap\u0026rdquo;, it was clear that the machine ran an older version of Nmap(2.02 to 5.21) which could be exploited to run a shell with root privileges. However, as I followed the article the machine responded with not being able to find nmap, I am currently stuck on this step. For now, I will continue my research and will update this article as soon as I find a solution to this problem.\n^Option 1 Artefact 10.2: nmap not found.\nREFERENCES Penetration Testing Lab. 2019.

The SLO’s are:\n Engage with Stakeholders to identify a problem (empathizing/ defining the problem) Apply Design Thinking to respond to a defined or newly identified problem Apply Technical skills to develop, model and/or evaluate design (refining/ test a prototype) Demonstrate effective collaboration and communication Conduct critical self and peer review and performance evaluation (both as an individual and a team)  ","permalink":"/publications/week-3/","tags":null,"title":"SUMMER STUDIO: SPRINT 3"},{"categories":null,"contents":" PROBLEM STATEMENT (SLO 1) In the midst of modern Cyber arms-race, human error still remains as the number one cause of data breaches. Human error accounts for more than half of all successful Cyber Security breaches, with social engineering being the forefront attack vector still relevant today. I have decided to incorporate this problem into the Web Application testing which we are currently undertaking this week.\nETHINCAL HACKING AND BUG BOUNTIES (SLO 2) Ethical hacking is a controlled method to find out the weaknesses and vulnerabilities existing in a system or network. In the current technology- centric society, no business is without the use of IT, but such dependency comes at a cost without proper security countermeasures. Mr. Agarwal from TechnoSip Inc summed it up quite well, “Essentially, they\u0026rsquo;re the gatekeepers for the organization, in order to prevent an unethical hacker from inflicting any damage.” (Forbes.com, 2019) Current trends of rewarding bug bounties and hiring penetration testing services allows a company to receive vital feedback on its defensive capabilities.\nA responsible disclosure policy is the first step a company can take to protect itself from a premature vulnerability release to the public. The responsible disclosure is different from a full disclosure model as there is a time frame for the issue to be patched before it is disclosed to the public. The following is an example:\n^SLO 2 Artefact 1: An example of responsible disclosure policy for the ficticious company ACME corporation.\nDuring sprint 1, our group completed our presentation on bug bounty programs, with bug crowd being the main site of research. This week I aim to test web applications under a responsible disclosure from Bug Crowd using the techniques I gained from participating in Pentesterlabs. The target scope with additional details is provided after a program is selected, program such as Netflix and Stan both possess relevant responsible disclosure policy tagged in their web application programs.\n^SLO 2 Artefact 2: Bug Bounty program by Netflix on Bugcrowd.\nSLO 2 is reached as the newly identified problem, web application security can be mitigated through bug bounty program hosted by organisations such Bugcrowd and HackerOne.\nFOCUS AREA: CLICKJACKING (SLO 3 + 4) Click-Jacking otherwise known as \u0026lsquo;UI redress attack\u0026rsquo; combines both elements of social engineering and Web application to \u0026ldquo;hijack\u0026rdquo; clicks and routing them to dangerous domains or applications. The technique is quite simple, the attacker will first need to create a combination of sylesheets, iframes and text boxes to bait the user into believing that they are typing their passwords to a legit site.\nOWASP.org presented an excellent example:\nFor example, imagine an attacker who builds a web site that has a button on it that says \u0026ldquo;click here for a free iPod\u0026rdquo;. However, on top of that web page, the attacker has loaded an iframe with your mail account, and lined up exactly the \u0026ldquo;delete all messages\u0026rdquo; button directly on top of the \u0026ldquo;free iPod\u0026rdquo; button. The victim tries to click on the \u0026ldquo;free iPod\u0026rdquo; button but instead actually clicked on the invisible \u0026ldquo;delete all messages\u0026rdquo; button. In essence, the attacker has \u0026ldquo;hijacked\u0026rdquo; the user\u0026rsquo;s click, hence the name \u0026ldquo;Clickjacking\u0026rdquo;. - www.owasp.org/index.php/Clickjacking\n*note: Due to the disclosure nature of this program, I have censored all information regarding the program website.\nSo starting off, I began testing the website with OWASP Zed Attack Proxy(ZAP), a tool to automatically scan security vulnerabilities in a web application. which yielded one medium level bug as shown below.\n^SLO 3 Artefact 1: Flags found in the target site by OWASP ZAP.\nThe next step was to analyse the report, which showed that alert level, description and solution to the vulnerability.\n^SLO 3 Artefact 2: HTML report generated by OWASP ZAP.\nFinally I conducted my research from numerous sources such as OWASP Click-Jacking to learn about this technique and its implications upon the users and completed a final check on the target website to confirm the vulnerability.\n^SLO 3 Artefact 3: Use inspect and search \u0026lsquo;iframe\u0026rsquo; to locate it.\nOverall, this vulnerability classifies in the medium catagory as it preys on human error, and can be remediated in two main ways according to OWASP:\n Sending the proper Content Security Policy (CSP) frame-ancestors directive response headers that instruct the browser to not allow framing from other domains. (This replaces the older X-Frame-Options HTTP headers.) Employing defensive code in the UI to ensure that the current frame is the most top level window.  Many sites were hacked this way, including Twitter, Facebook, Paypal and other sites. They are all fixed, of course but this problem is still relevant today as it is classified as a medium/low level vulnerability.\nSLO 3 is achieved through my discovery of the ClickJacking vulnerability, while SLO 4 is undertaken as we were give 3 minutes to present our findings to our \u0026lsquo;corporate stakeholders\u0026rsquo;. I successfully conveyed my research and received great feedback from Larry, our head educator.\nSLO 4 Artefact 1: My Presentation Slides\nPERSONAL REFLECTION (SLO 5) Previously in the about me section, my personal goals included:\n Understand tools and techniques from OWASP top 10 to relate to vulnerable web applications. Gain a better understanding of the Cyber Security Sector in general.  However, after the sprint 1, I have began developing a strong interest in bug bounty programs. Thus, the ultimate goal i have set for myself is to achieve a successful medium or high level bug report for a web- application based program on BugCrowd. Realistically, my current mindset still lacks the technical capabilities to visually identify anomalies in the web applications.\nTo achieve the level of competency to satisfy my goal, I will first develop the basic mindset of error testing through practice. I was recommended the course: Web for Pentester So for now my current milestone/plan is:\n Finish Web for Pentester by the end of the sprint 2. Research disclosed bug bounty reports. Practice hackthebox challenges.  REFERENCES Forbes.com. (2019). Ethics And Hacking: What You Need To Know.

Out of the many choices to select from, I chose Cybersecurity: An Offensive Mindset as my 6-credit summer course as my personal aim was to find an internship immediately after the holidays.\nOn the first day (4/02/2019) we were assigned to present upon a Cybersecurity topic of our own choice in groups of 4 to 5. The task was due on Wednesday (in two days), so I got to work immediately with picking out a group. The team I decided to join was composed of a mixed skillset, with the veterans being Jason, Andre and I as we were involved in the UTS Cybersec society beforehand. However, the new members: Frank and Vishal were both hard working software engineering students in their final year. The group selection gave us a perfect opportunity to practice our interpersonal, leadership and communication skills.\n^ SLO 1 Artefact 1: We decided to use Microsoft Teams as a form of communication.\nI strongly believe in the importance of team communication, so we used one of my preferred tools, Microsoft Teams to act as our project planner. After we dissected the project into 4 steps, we used google slides to complete our presentation slides. Of course, there was initial friction within the team when we were trying to decide upon the topic, but after a couple of rounds of voting we decided to research bug bounty and isolated steam as our technical case study.\n^ SLO 4 Artefact 1: Our team presenting at the front.\nSo, what have we achieved?\nThe topic we chose to present is the bug bounty program, where you “get paid to hack things”. A bug bounty is a program which crowdsources bug hunting for target software products and services which rewards hackers reporting these bugs with money and recognition.\nWe then delved into a case where valve pays 15000 pounds to a hacker who found a steam bug that generates free games. Artem, who was the hacker, passed in specific URL parameters that gave him access to API endpoint calls to get multiple game Product keys.\nOverall the presentation went extremely smoothly and gave us an important insight of teamwork, and provided the students with a fresh way to learn from each other. Thus SLO 1 was fulfilled as a group when we where trying to identify a Cyber Security problem, while SLO 4 was explored during our presentation and its completion process.\nHere is our presentation slides: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1e3WunCcSdGv09VA77-9W8lBUlbU3uerzyue-1ow_glc/edit?usp=sharing\nSLO 2, SLO 3 The most difficult task given to us in week 1 was to create our own Static website to host weekly reflections, submissions and ultimately post our portfolio which is due in week 4.\nWe were given the following intro:\n• Dynamic sites require the use of server-side scripting that increases the possibilities of vulnerabilities and attacks. Whilst dynamic sites are required for many web applications, static sites are gaining popularity for their simplicity and for their increased security\n• Static sites are presented using plain HTML with no server-side scripting required. This usually requires the use of a static site generator that is able to take input files written in mark-up (e.g. Markdown)\nIn all honesty, other than a blog which I created using Blogger, I had no experience in creating a static website. Thus, after conducting my personal research, I first started with Jekyll to generate a site using an existing theme. However, I ran into many troubles with server hosting, so I decided to skip the static generation component and started with a template found on startBootstrap.com. After consulting with a senior software student(Vishal) who was familiar with front-end development, I was taught the Git process on the Friday afternoon.\n^ SLO 3 Artefact 1: The succeeded Git push onto my master branch.\nI started off learning the utilisation of GitHub-Pages, and through trial and error, I linked GitHub with GitKraken, a Git Client widely used in the development industry. Saturday was dedicated to the addition of all the content on this website and learning HTML on the go. It was quite the challenge as the only language I learnt during my first year was Java, but I viewed this as an opportunity to learn a new skill and further advance myself outside of my comfort zone.\n^ SLO 2 Artefact 1: The HTML code I used in this website.\nThe creation of the static website further reinforced the notion of combining technical skills outlined in SLO 3 with the creative adaption outlined in SLO 2 to overcome obstacles such as the problematic server.\nSLO 5 + SUBJECT REFLECTION The teaching staff was extremely supportive as they conducted their teaching. Larry was very direct and concise when disclosing information, while the Microsoft Team class group was also a great addition to aid our communication when we wanted to voice our questions. Darsh is very supportive in the communication side as he answered all my questions about the presentation task and gave our ideas great feedback.\n^ SLO 5 Artifact 1: Darsh responding to my question on Teams.\nAnother feedback session was held between Larry and each student after the presentation, which encompassed our personal progress in the subject. Thus, from undertaking the first week of this subject I am already optimistic that this subject will cover all my expectations and aims outlined at the start.\nSUBJECT LEARNING OUTCOMES(SLOs) There are 5 major subject learning outcomes with this course and the achievement of these outcomes will be outlined by this portfolio.

It was during year 9, at school, when I was tasked to build a Rube Goldberg machine that automated many human processes. Back then, it wasn\u0026rsquo;t an important thing to think about your future career but for me, I found a great appeal to the logical thought process that engineers possessed. However, now at University of Technology Sydney it is clear that everything i did back then was a continued investment for my dream of becoming an engineer.\nDuring my school days, I spent my time carefully crafting my identity, ideology and capital to further myself in the path to create as many opportunities as possible. While everyone was having lunch during lunch breaks, I was involving myself in the environmental club. Which I then used as a stepping stone to advance as the school\u0026rsquo;s environmental leader, where I shaped and managed the school\u0026rsquo;s environment with continuous restoration projects.\nHowever, the turning point came to me on May 2017, when the education platform Edmodo was compromised which resulted in the exposure of 77 million records comprised of around 43 million unique customer email addresses. The records in the breach included usernames, email addresses and B-crypt hashes password hashes of teachers/ students. The helpless feeling of being unable to do anything motivated me to seek out the Cyber Security path, other than software engineering component.\n^Illustration from deepweb-sites.com\nThe Cybersec Society at University of Technology was also a major factor for my pursuit of this career path. One of most important things I have learnt from its members is to proactively utilise my knowledge to benefit the general public. The society actively engages in workshop sessions to educate the public regarding the current cyber attack trends, such as OSINT.\nOverall the engineer identity is vital in the modern cyberscape, as it is the gears that drives continuous innovation to solve humanity\u0026rsquo;s current and future problems, \u0026ldquo;As such, a strong sense of engineering identity is marked by a deepening commitment to pursue a career in engineering.\u0026rdquo; (Meyers, Silliman, Ohland, Pawley, \u0026amp;Smith, 2012) despite its coherent complexity.\n","permalink":"/publications/investment-analysis/","tags":null,"title":"Investment Analysis"},{"categories":null,"contents":" My name is Andy Lee.

I love problem solving and learning new skillsets, so I dedicated most of my first-year to the UTS Cyber Security Society as an opportunity to learn and gain exposure to the industry. Throughout my studies so far, UTS has provided plenty of software and project- based subjects, however from the day I joined the UTS Cyber Sec, I have always looked for an accredited course that enabled more hands- on work in penetration testing. Thus, when Larry who is the head educator of this summer studio gave me an outline, I immediately jumped on board.\nI have personally been involved in the Cyber Security Challenge Australia (CYSCA) 2018, placing first in the First-year division as the team strategist I hope to cover the offensive side of Cyber Security through this summer studio, Cyber Security: An Offensive Mindset.

The SLO’s are:\n Engage with Stakeholders to identify a problem (empathizing/ defining the problem) Apply Design Thinking to respond to a defined or newly identified problem Apply Technical skills to develop, model and/or evaluate design (refining/ test a prototype) Demonstrate effective collaboration and communication Conduct critical self and peer review and performance evaluation (both as an individual and a team)  ","permalink":"/publications/about-me/","tags":null,"title":"SUMMERSTUDIO- CYBER SECURITY: AN OFFENSIVE MINDSET"},{"categories":null,"contents":"^ Kiwicon stage during welcome ceremony\nCompact and surrounded by nature, Wellington, New Zealand reminisces creativity with a powerful mix of culture, nature and cuisine. Kiwicon 2038 was held on the 16th to the 17th of November in Wellington, held at the Michael Fowler Centre. At its core, Kiwicon is a hacker conference that deal with the intricacies of breaking into, breaking around technological systems.\n\u0026ldquo;If you\u0026rsquo;re new to hacker conferences, well, we think you\u0026rsquo;re in for a treat. Kiwicon is probably not like any other tech conference you\u0026rsquo;ve been to - there\u0026rsquo;s no dry, boring talks (we hope), no vendor booths, no bags of crappy pens and tripe you don\u0026rsquo;t want. Instead you\u0026rsquo;ll get people who are engaged with tech because they are pathologically curious; people who like poking things till they break just because its there and then figuring out how to fix them.\u0026rdquo; - Kiwicon.org\n^ Jason (Chatime enthusiast) and I with the some Cybersec members in the background.\nAround a week before the conference, 10 members from UTS Cybersec Society and I arrived at Wellington. With around 3000 people attending the conference, a great deal of effort was applied to each of the talks and activities. From the \u0026ldquo;Victorian Era lesson on fighting the surveillance state\u0026rdquo; to the \u0026ldquo;Back-dooring with service workers\u0026rdquo; the scope was stretched to accommodate the most current topics of each Cyber-Security discipline.\n^ One of the presentations on the second day.\n^ Having a crack at the numerous locks and handcuffs in the Physical Security workshop\nOne of the most interesting workshop available at the lobby was Phy-sec, which deals with the physical vulnerabilities of access points such as company servers.\n^Obligatory Cat pic from our Airbnb.\nOverall I strongly believe Kiwicon is a must for anyone interested in Cyber security regardless of background or ability, as it provides the perfect environment to socialize and engage other professionals in the industry. The talks are great to explore current security trends with each speaker having a thorough understanding of the subject, while workshops provided a good amount of hands- on exercise.\nRating: 10 / 10.\n^UTS Cybersec group photo edited by Jai(2Keebs) and Andre(Pags).\n","permalink":"/publications/kiwicon2038ad/","tags":null,"title":"KIWICON 2038AD"},{"categories":null,"contents":" INVESTMENT ANALYSIS My investment towards becoming an engineer. Hello there! As this is my first journal entry i would like to share something special, and has made a profound impact towards my perspective upon Cyber Security.\nThe society is called UTS CyberSec, the one and only Cyber Security society in this University. The club was founded around a two years ago (2017) with its core members coming mostly from IT backgrounds. After some policy changes here and there, the club began to focus mainly on preparing students for the emerging Cybersec field in Australia. Every Thursday there was club training from 4 to 6:30 pm, experts from the club\u0026rsquo;s sponsors came in often to do workshops and activities to educate us upon the most current tools of the trade\u0026hellip; Hell even the members were some of the most opportunist and eccentric i have ever met. There\u0026rsquo;s Larry the Dad of the society, a humorous Russian bad ass who also works as a tutor for the Uni, TwoKeebs (not his real name) who got his name from brute- forcing an access point using two keyboards, Luke the amazing head educator that was teaching us younguns despite him being only a few years older. Darsh, one of the senior member of the society was always there if you are in a pickle. Just to name a few.\n\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\n\u0026ldquo;24 hours?\u0026rdquo; was my first words after the competition briefing, \u0026ldquo;Where do we even sleep?\u0026rdquo; came after. It was the middle of my first year at University of Technology Sydney, and all of the training just flew over my head when i first delved into the details of this competition.\n\u0026ldquo;CySCA is Australia’s only national cyber security competition. It runs over 24-hours and will test both your technical skills and communication know-how. It’s not easy, but it’s heaps of fun, and the opportunities you get from participating are fantastic.\u0026rdquo; - competition website\n5 teams of 4 will represent each University for this competition, and the format is simple. Earn as much points from flags within the 24 hour limit, you may only work with the other 3 members.\nTeam name: 3% paradigm\n Red Wheelbarrow(not his real name) was our team captain and dealt with exploit/reverse engineering.  -My primary role specifically was the team tactician, focusing on analyzing the strength and weakness of my team and learning the blind spots so that I can assist during the competition.\n Brandon was in charge of external/web application security.  -Nick is the Internally/ network security guy.\n^ our team\u0026rsquo;s setup table.\nSadly I am not allowed to disclose the content of the competition, but I would like to share my experience. To put it simply, it was and still is one of the single most memorable thing I have ever experienced in my life. The anxious urge to look up our team ranking on the projector above, the colorful RGB\u0026rsquo;s responding to the marvelous symphonies of keyboard clicks. How can I ever forget the blissful silence when I finally caught some rest outside on the hallway sofa, brightly lit by the ceiling LED. There will be frustration of course but trust me, that euphoria at the end when the timer hits 0. It will make you feel invincible like conquering the Everest, but with a team that stood by your side until the very end. I am both lucky and privileged to be a part of the first year team that is ranked first in the first year division and 32nd in mixed.\nThank you for reading and lastly i would like to share my favorite quote: \u0026ldquo;Opportunity multiply when they are seized.\u0026rdquo; - Sun Tzu\n^Our team captain and I\n","permalink":"/publications/cysca2018/","tags":null,"title":"CYSCA 2018"},{"categories":null,"contents":" Paranoid with wireless cameras hidden in the Airbnb? Or the ability to disable your roommate\u0026rsquo;s Netflix stream. The WiFi Deauther OLED MINI is the next leap forward of the Deauther series by DSTIKE, a low-cost WiFi deauthentication project that originates from Spacehuhn.\nHardware-wise, the MINI boasts only ~80mA of power usage, with an extremely compact board design of only 68mm x 28mm. For the user, a SH1106 1.3\u0026rdquo; OLED display and tactile switch provides basic menu control, while power relies upon a common micro-USB cable.\nFrom the official store site:\n Only ~80mA power usage LM39100 Low Voltage Low-Dropout Regulator TP4056+PL5353A battery protection solution Included 2dB antenna All GPIO breakouts and 3.3 and 5V output 2 LEDs to indicate battery charging status (Red:Charging,Green:Full) Protection: short, over charging, over discharging, temperature  On the software side, the MINI comes pre-installed with the latest ESP8266 Deauther software to perform different attacks on WiFi networks. From boot-up, the menu will display the following: SCAN, SELECT, ATTACK, PACKET MONITOR and LED. For a common \u0026lsquo;deauth\u0026rsquo; attack, you will need follow the steps bellow:\n Select \u0026lsquo;SCAN\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;SCAN AP + ST\u0026rsquo; Wait for the Scan to be completed and then select the AP\u0026rsquo;s and Stations in the \u0026lsquo;SELECT\u0026rsquo; menu that you want to attack. Select the \u0026lsquo;ATTACK\u0026rsquo; menu and select the \u0026lsquo;DEAUTH\u0026rsquo; option. Initialize the attack by selecting \u0026lsquo;START\u0026rsquo; and stopping the attack with \u0026lsquo;STOP\u0026rsquo;.  There are three main functions of the MINI,\nDeauth: Closes the connection of WiFi devices by sending deauthentication frames to access points and client devices you selected.\nBeacon: Beacon packets are used to advertise access points. By continuously sending beacon packets out, it will look like you created new WiFi networks.\nProbe: Probe requests are sent by client devices to ask if a known network is nearby. Use this attack to confuse WiFi trackers by asking for networks that you specified in the SSID list.\nWifi Jammer vs Deauther A jammer creates noise and overloads the communication between devices, being harder to acquire than the Deauther due to its specialist hardware. On the other hand, a Deauther can be derived from a range of equipment such as laptops, or a cheap module with a Wifi-chip that supports packet injection. The Deauther relies on the unencrypted management frames of Wifi to trick the targeted device to terminate connection with its access point. Finally, the biggest difference lies in the Deauther\u0026rsquo;s ability to target \u0026lsquo;Stations\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;Access points\u0026rsquo;, while the jammer will block everything in a given radius.\nDisclaimer!
